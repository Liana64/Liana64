Dear friends and gentle hearts, hello and welcome. My name is Liana and I am a woman of no particular note.

It's the industrious and, really quite strange, year of our dead & departed lord, twenty twenty four (2024). I am sitting in front of a wooden desk, center of a spacious room in the back. We call it the back room. There's a fan running and two women carefully speaking in the distance. Beneath this there is a deep stillness syncopated by the harmonic trills of what we call "living in the big city."

I open the blinds and let in some sunlight. I wonder at who might read this text some day, how the letters transmit over light, how space evaporates, mined away by the industry and systems and machines of our time; that semiotic transcendence, that diversion from infinite and deathless non-abstraction.

Feel free to browse my wares below.
